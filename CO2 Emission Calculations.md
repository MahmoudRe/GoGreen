## CO2 Emission calculations

#### Lowering temperature: 
Base heating temperature is assumed to be 21 degrees. According to our sources, 554.7g CO2 is reduced per Celsius.

Reduction is assumed to be 3 degrees, therefore having 18 degrees instead of 21, so emission reduction is 1.5kg.

#### Vegan meal :
Eating a regular meal is 3.96kg CO2 per kg per person, 2.22kg C02 per kg per person for vegan meal, therefore reduction is (1.74 kg CO2 saved) per kg per person. 

One meal on average is considered to be 500g therefore 1kg CO2 reduction per meal per person( just to have a round number, instead of 0.9).

#### Buying local produce :
Buying a local product produces ~1kg CO2 per kg of produce compared to 3.96 for a regular meal, therefore 3 kg CO2 saved per person per kg of produce.

Assuming the weight for buying local products mainly fruits, vegetables, grains etc can be around 3kg, therefore 9kg co2 saved.

#### Solar Panels:
Using the average generated electricity for a solar panel, with optimal angle, in the Netherlands and the input of the user. Will result in  energy produced per day by the user.
Comparing that to the amount of CO2 emissions per kWh of electricity in the Netherlands will give an indication of how much the solar panels save per day in kg CO2 saved.
Displayed in the app: The top right of the home screen shows the daily co2 emissions saved, and if you add a solar panel it will update your total co2 reduction with the amount of co2 saved so far.
Formula: Area (m2) * Peak Power (kWp) * 931 (generated electricity (kWh/kWp)) / (365 (days) * 0.526 (kg CO2/kWh of gray energy)

#### Transportation section:
All calculations are done according to the EU policy of restriction of CO2 emission per each vehicle.
Avoiding the complexity and to keep the interface user-friendly, we take the average CO2 emission of cars, trains and buses.
Having said that, the CO2 emissions will be as follows:
130g/km traveled by car.
45g/km traveled by bus and train.

So we can say for bike, we state the CO2 reduction equals to the full amount of CO2 emission from car.
While in public transport, the reduction equals to CO2 emission from car minus the CO2 emission from bus and train.
