# Sprint Review Week 2

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Java version inconsistency
Because some frameworks required java 11 and some people didn't have java 11 installed and there was not communicated that java 11 was necessary, we ran in some slight problems where (almost) nothing worked on when you didn't have java 11.

To solve this issue, everyone is now running java 11.

----------
### UI Problems encountered

The UI team had some issues figuring out where to start and what tools can used etc, they started off the hard way by coding down paramaters after which they also got stuck because they were not able to run the code on maven.

### Login/database Problems encountered
The login/database team were able to setup maven correctly with the correct dependencies and libraries, therefore they have used JavaFX and scenebuilder to build the login UI and SQlite for a simple database.
Even though at the end they managed the finish the task for the current sprint, it took a lot of time and frustration to figure out all the necessary things listed above. The login team introduced JavaFX and scenebuilder to the UI team, thus after this meeting all team members are capable of using the tools required to successfully build the UI elements.

### Server Problems encountered

#### Problem 1: Had to change away from sockets
We had a working server, however we made it with sockets, thus we had to change the whole thing and had to restart from scratch.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
  -  Not yet existing

## Adjustments for next sprint
  -  Better communication on system wide changes, like setting a minimum jdk version.
  -  Consulting about tools and their usage
