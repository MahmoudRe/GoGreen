## Notes
 
 As can be seen from the test coverage report we are haven't done anything so far but with todays meeting our issues got clarified and by week 5 our code should have at least 70% coverage.
 We had issues because of the implementation of the controlleres which made them untestable, however our TA helped us out with a solution.
