# Week 3 Sprint 2

## Points of action

        - Server deployment with external service such as heroku
        - Server connection with database
        - Profile UI
        - HomeScreen UI finish up
        - Transportation UI
        - Eat vegan feature
        
## Notes
 Due to lack of ability and knowledge we were not really sure how to divide
 tasks to smaller chunks.
 - We are still not able to divide down issues into smaller chunks during the
 sprint planning session, therefore our approach will be to start working on the bigger-scale issue and once we have started and have a better understanding we will update the issue board with smaller issues.
