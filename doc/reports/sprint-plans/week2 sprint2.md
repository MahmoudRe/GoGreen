# Week 2 Sprint 1

## Points of action

 - 3 main things to be done on the first sprint:  
        - Basic server/request response(David & Daniel)  
        - Home screen UI(Mahmoud, Alex & Pedro)  
        - Functioning login with basic database setup(Gian Marco & Dimo)  
        
## Notes
 Due to lack of ability and knowledge we were not really sure how to divide tasks to smaller chunks.
 Therefore we have decided to make smaller teams and try to work those parts out together.
 We will evaluate this approach next week in the sprint review based on our accomplishments.
