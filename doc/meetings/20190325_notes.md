### Mahmoud
Connected all the screens, updated all the UI elements to a uniform standard, integrated the jfoenix library for animation and material design.
Also, tried to separate the side panel with its controller from the actual pages and make it foldable, but this result unwanted issues, therefore this idea is canceled. 

### David
Davis is missing from this meeting as well(he was missing on week 6). He hasn't completed his task, he is not communicating with the team, we don't know what's going on.
His actions should have serious implications on his progress with the course.
