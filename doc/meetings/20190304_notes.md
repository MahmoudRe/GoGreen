## Notes
 
 - Gian Marco - The “eat vegan” button is implemented, it updates the DB. The log out button is completely implemented. The username is displayed  on the top of the menu in the home screen (to be implemented throughout all other screens). Login validation was implemented successfully.

 - Mahmoud - Struggled with the implementation of Google maps in the transportation screen. The goal is to have fields in which you can enter your starting and final points in order to be presented with a route.

 - Pedro - Managed to do a prototype for the profile screen. Still needs to do some work on the layout. Struggled with some of the elements present in the profile screen UI.

 - Daniel - Server is on Heroku but connection with the project is not ready yet. The goal is that the connection issue is fixed by the end of the day.

 - David - The connection between the server and the database is done.

 - Alexander - Progress on the home screen and leaderboard layouts. The functionality is to be done in the following weeks. Login and signup standardisation of style.

 - Models should be tested. UI is excluded from testing.  Controller should access fxml send it to class and do magic there (tests included). Switch to MVC. 

#### Bonus:

 - setting up CI
